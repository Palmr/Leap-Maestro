# Leap Maestro #

Project developed for London Gamecraft 2014. Using a leap motion to control the volume of several audio tracks that make up a song. Points awarded for getting the volume as close as possible to the target volume for each track.

Audio tracks used are not included as they're large and copyrighted.

Code is really rough, but for a few hours hacking it's surprisingly playable so try not to laugh too much.

## Requirements ##
- A web browser
- A leap Motion
- Some cut up audio tracks provided by you, and timing events hard coded in the JS...
